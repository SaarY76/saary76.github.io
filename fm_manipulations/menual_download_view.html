    <h1>How To download and install View file</h1>
    <p>First Download in the previous page the View file</p>
    <p>
      Move the Views in the downloaded Zip file to the folder that shows in the
      picture, usually it's in :
      <br />
      <span
        >C:\Users\<span style="font-weight: lighter">Your User Name</span
        >\Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2024\views</span
      >
    </p>
    <img height="500px" src="./fm_view_folder.png" alt="" />
    <p>Now open the Football Manager game</p>
    <p>
      For this tutorial I will load it to the <span>Players search</span> table
      but it's also the same for the <span>Shortlist</span> and the
      <span>Squad</span> tables
    </p>
    <p>
      In the left menu of the screen go to
      <span>Scouting</span>
      And then in the top menu click on <span>Players</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      To import the View to the Player Serach table click on the button that is
      right to the text that show how many players found and follow the next
      steps in the next pictures
    </p>
    <img src="./how_to_import_vview.png" alt="" />
    <br />
    <p>
      When you see this screen popping click on the
      <span>FM All Attributes</span> file you downloaded <br />and then click on
      the <span>Load</span> button
    </p>
    <img src="./load_view.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      Now you will see the View with all of the new columns in the players
      search table
    </p>
    <p>
      These are also the instructions for the shortlist and the squad screens to
      load up their Views
